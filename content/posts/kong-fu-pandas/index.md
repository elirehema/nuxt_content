### What a Film Festival is Like

The Godfather Part III, X-Men: The Last Stand, Spider-Man 3 — cinematic history is rife with gratuitous third installments that make viewers wish the filmmakers had simply stopped after the first two outings. Not surprisingly, when I walked into the theater to see Kung Fu Panda 3, it was not with the highest of expectations. I must confess, however, that by the end of the movie I was pleasantly surprised. While it may not quite live up to its illustrious predecessors, it’s certainly entertaining enough to merit a trip to the theater, and perhaps—dare I say it—even additional sequels.


### Doctor Strange Not So Strange ?

The plot sounds simple enough: Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) is leaving his kung fu students at the Jade Palace in order to go on a personal journey of discovery, leaving Po (Jack Black) in charge. Though Po’s first day as substitute teacher is an undisputed failure, this does not deter Shifu- who simply tells his disciple, “If you only do what you can do, you will never be more than you are now.” Meanwhile Kai (J. K. Simmons), an ancient warrior who apparently was like a brother to Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim), has returned from the spirit realm and threatens to destroy all that Oogway created. Po learns of Kai’s return shortly after being reunited with his biological father (Bryan Cranston), and decides to accompany his father back to the secret Panda village to master qi, learn the life of the panda, discover what it truly means to be the Dragon Warrior, and improve his teaching skills along the way.

### In Civil War, Marvel Triumphs Once Again

As you can see, the simple plot seems rather complex if you are unfamiliar with the Panda’s past. Though the film is directed primarily at a young audience, it is still necessary to be acquainted with the first two films to fully appreciate what’s going on. Like the first two installments, this latest one features spectacular animation that is gorgeous on the big screen. In fact, this may be one of the few areas in which Panda 3 surpasses its predecessors. The mountainous landscapes, in particular, are quite striking, and the animation style used in the depiction of the spirit realm is also a visual highlight.
